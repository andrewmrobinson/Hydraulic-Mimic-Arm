## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r gripstrength}
grip <- read_xlsx("data/gripstrength.xlsx")
grip <- grip %>% gather(hand,strength,c("Right","Left"))
grip <- grip %>% unite(genhan,Gender,hand,sep=" ")
ggplot(grip)+geom_line(data=grip,aes(x=Age,y=strength,colour=genhan),size=2)+labs(title="Power grasp strength vs Age",y="Strength (kg)",colour="Legend")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r gripstrength2}
benchmark <- read_xlsx("data/benchmark.xlsx")
benchmark$Name <- factor(benchmark$Name,levels=c("i-limb ultra","BeBionic3","Michelangelo","SmartHand","Vanderbilt University Hand","Benchmark"))
colcolours <- c(NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"yellow")
ggplot(benchmark,aes(Name,`Grip Strength`,fill=colcolours))+geom_col()+guides(fill=FALSE)+labs(title="Power grasp comparison of powered prostheses vs Benchmark",y="Grip Strength (kg)",x="")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
